Step-by-Step Process You Followed (All in terminal)

Created a new Conda environment

conda create -n handcv python=3.10


Created an isolated environment named handcv.

Installed Python 3.10 and all essential dependencies (pip, setuptools, tk, etc.).

This ensures you have a clean Python space just for computer vision projects.

Activated the environment
conda activate handcv


Switched to the new environment.

(At this stage, OpenCV wasn’t installed yet, so importing cv2 failed — that’s normal.)

Created another clean environment
conda create -n cv python=3.10


You removed and recreated another environment named cv, to keep it simpler.

Activated the cv environment
conda activate cv


This made cv your active environment, where all further installations went.

Installed OpenCV
conda install -c conda-forge opencv


Installed OpenCV 4.12.0 along with dependencies:

ffmpeg (for video)

numpy (for array ops)

qt6 (for GUI windows like imshow)

Verified OpenCV works successfully with your Python code.

Tested OpenCV script

python motion_detect.py


The motion detection program ran successfully and captured frames from your camera.

The “KeyboardInterrupt” errors appeared only because you manually stopped execution (Ctrl + C), which is normal.

Tried installing Mediapipe

Code :conda install -c conda-forge mediapipe opencv


Mediapipe is not available via Conda on Windows — hence the PackagesNotFoundError.

This is expected behavior.

Fix: You must install Mediapipe via pip inside your cv environment.

Next Step (To Add Mediapipe Support)

While in your active environment (cv):

pip install mediapipe


If you face a version error, use:

pip install mediapipe --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple


Then test:

Code: python -c "import mediapipe as mp; print(mp.__version__)"
